# jpo-conflictvisualizer

The CIMMS Conflict Visualizer is a web-based user interface for configuring the [CIMMS Conflict Monitor](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-conflictmonitor), as well as displaying notifications, downloading data, and visualizing conflicts. This repository also contains the associated API, which hosts endpoints for the GUI to access data from the jpo-conflicmonitor MongoDB database.

This application is fully dockerized, with the API and GUI expected to be deployed separately, alongside an instance of the [jpo-ode](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode), [jpo-geojsonconverter](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-geojsonconverter), [jpo-conflictmonitor](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-conflictmonitor), and [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker). Information on how to build and run those projects is available in their repositories.

This application is a part of the [JPO Connected Vehicle Portal](https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-cvportal), which is made up of this repository and others, to provide a single application with access to other connected intersection tools.

To provide feedback, we recommend that you create an "issue" in this repository (<https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-conflictvisualizer/issues>). You will need a GitHub account to create an issue. If you donâ€™t have an account, a dialog will be presented to you to create one at no cost.
